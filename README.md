**Overview**
This project is a simple Python script that creates and displays a solid color panel using OpenCV. Whether you're learning image processing or need a quick way to generate a solid color background, this tool can help you visualize and experiment with color panels in BGR (Blue-Green-Red) format.

**Features**
- Create a solid color panel of any size and color.
- Easy to customize the dimensions and color values.
- Simple and lightweight script with no external dependencies beyond OpenCV and NumPy.

**How It Works**
- The script generates a blank image using NumPy.
- The entire image is filled with a user-defined color in BGR format.
- OpenCV is used to display the panel in a resizable window.
